// QSTN: which parts of flow does Streak cover, and how do we deal with data redundancy.  Streak as source of truth until when... Also Sendgrid and Streak maybe having different source of Truth, dat's risky.
// Sendgrid should JUST store the basic name and email stuff, I think.  Our first step is to get them into sendgrid

// There are lots of places where the email address lives! including production db later.  may  wanna think abt how these map to each other.  and how they get updated..
