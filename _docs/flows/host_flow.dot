// QSTN: should guest and host profiles be different?  note that this relates to UX of above question.  well, i'm seeing a lot of the questions are the same.
// QSTN: should host application be its own form separate from that early one to grab their email?

//TODO: indicate how long they can expect to wait between stages.
// TODO: all the guests step pretty much apply to hosts.  consider that in these flows

 // TODO: Failure states too

// QSTN: we might reject someone as a host but accept them as a guest?  i suppose there are levels to host rejection.

// TODO: Handle the different region cases, thinking long term and then mapping back to what we have now (Austin region or not Austin).

// TODO: determine what edits or cancelations the host can do.  Consider that they could email us also.
// Note: There is an analogy between throwing an invite-only party and Launching a city.
// Note: Regions are [circles or polygons?] geofences where hosting is allowed. Part of idea is to build real community and buzz, launching cities one by one as a kind of exclusive thing.
