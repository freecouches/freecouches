//Anything where we're waiting should have some kinda drip reminder to continya.
// take account of not knowing whether "Waitlist V1" were guest or host!!
// signing up for us should also trigger contact info entry in sendgrid, like if it was a mailing list subscription.  make sure to include that in diagram.
// QSTN: when would we stop using Streak for the Guest Waitlist?  I think we only use it as a makeshift db until we have a prod db?  But Host Waitlist it continues to be a useful application processing mechanism for picking your top 100 hosts as you launch a city.  And then it continues to collect a waitlist of ppl..
// Google Maps for location autocomplete

// Take note of the BS we'll hav to do for waitlist v1 back-compatibility

// if we have a separate google form for the Host, that would link to the Streak box?
